# # !!! THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE: The assumption I will use is that the data for all bridges (an individual bridge is denoted by STRUCNUM) that are common to all the years of data being analyzed (2016 - 2023 in this case) is to be considered, meaning that the data (condition states of individual bridge elements) associated with the bridges common across 8 years shall be used even if the data provided for a bridge one year is not provided for all the other years or is provided sporadically for other years (i.e. if the bridge components (EN) rated for condition state one year are not rated for all years - BUT some components of said bridge are rated for all years being considered and analyzed then those condition states for those elements can be used as part of the data).  For instance, a very common bridge component (or EN, element number) is a deck constructed of reinforced concrete, which I refer to as a variable as deck_rc, and this EN is number 12 as denoted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Specification for the National Bridge Inventory, Bridge Elements.  As such it may be that the number of observations across the years considered is not the same for that element number (EN) each year- some years may include condition states associated with that element present for that bridge  in some but not all years, but it is my intention to use as many observations as possible for as many bridge parts as possible to attempt to make the computer model accurate.  Again, this is subject to change.

Make the STRUCNUM of the list strucnum_in_all into individual variables (there will be 8847 of them I assume) using the code at the beginning of this line as a guide to come up with a variable that will have the nomenclature eN_in_sTrucnum_000000000000004 (the one shown here would be a variable for STRUCNUM = 000000000000004 without anything attached to it denoting the year assessed) as a means of storing the all EN associated with that STRUCNUM for each year so there will be 8847*5 = 44235 total of those variables
#
# # I think I need to scrap all of that and just find a method that will make the set of bridges that can merge on STRUCNUM and EN obvious and therefore not be forced to come up with a means of removing individual or multiple excess lines of data from each year's individual df after coming up with a list of common EN per STRUCNUM across all years being assessed!!!!
#
# # !!!
#
# # Is this the place where I go and make all the necessary dfs for each EN PER YEAR and then follow that with code to add the time component for each individual year so as to avoid having to ensure the number of observations per year is the same?  THe answer to that question is yes.
#
# # Create EN dataframes for each year prior to concatenation of those dataframes to facilitate inserting the time component individually for each bridge element for that year based on number of observations made that year.
#
# # !!! Of course the comment above is making me wonder if the idea that I should at least be able to infer that the same amount of time has passed between successive observations of said bridge element (EN) may cause inaccuracy which would be the case if the observations of a part of a bridge were made over successive years (e.g. if STRUCNUM = 000000000000004 is observed in all years being considered but a condition state for EN = 12 IS NOT recorded each year) it would be difficult to say that the same amount of time has passed between each observation of the bridge element (EN).
#
# # !!! Going to change the protocol for this analysis as follows:
#
# #  a.	IF a bridge (STRUCNUM) is not present in all years being considered that STRUCNUM (bridge) is eliminated from the data.
# #       i. 	IF a bridge element present in a bridge not meeting the criteria outlined in a. above (i.e. a bridge or STRUCNUM that is not eliminated from the data because that STRUCNUM IS present in all years under consideration) is not present and its condition state observed and recorded in all years being considered that bridge element (EN) is eliminated from the data.  (So eliminate the bridges first if they aren’t present in all the years then eliminate the elements from the bridges if the elements are not present in all the years for those bridges)
#
#
# # Now begins the merging of different dataframes: Going to start by merging the two longest which are df2021CA and df2022CA
#
# # The nomenclature for these merges is to place the two digit year corresponding to the next smallest df number at the beginning of the variable name as the merges are made, i.e. in the manner that df20_21_22 is merged below after the larger dfs of df2022CA and df2021CA have been merged.

# # Thinking about replacing missing data for some of the elements:
# # Rationale for the replacement of data for deck_rc is that the subset of data will consist of all bridges that have observations in all years AND at least one EN observation in one year- thus replacing the the EN observations for years where no data is present but at least one observation is present in at least one year for a bridge.
#
# # 62 of the possible EN are NoneType objects (i.e. there are no observations of those EN present across all years being considered) which is not surprising because the list of total possible elements is exhaustive and many of the total of  124 elements are specialized types of construction that do not see use in most typical highway bridges.
#
#
# # Create time column for the plots.
# # Make the required dfs and then make plots and perform regression.
# # Create a column to compute the percentage of each CS (condition state) as means to determine when that CS might overtake all of the elements to which it pertains.
#
#
# # I expect the most commonly used elements present in the data to be the type with the suffix _rc meaning reinforced concrete and _pc meaning prestressed concrete.

# # abmt_rc Bridge abutments, reinforced concrete
#
# # Let's remove any CS1 entries in the abmt_rc dataframe that have progressed through CS1 (i.e. meaning CS1 = 0) entirely and will only produce subsequent CS1 observations if an outside influence acts upon that bridge element.   I take outside influence to generally mean replacement of the element completely which would mean the element was new and by default in a condition state of CS1- although there may be refurbishment or repair actions that may return the element or a portion of that element to a state of CS1.
#
# # So originally after the abmt_rc entries were placed into their own dataframe the number of rows was 61376.
#
# # !!!
# # Here is where the abmt_rc df is important to look at, rather than create more variables and make things hard to follow I'm going to adjust the equation below so that the CS under review is different while looking for a line of best fit in the different condition states.

# # Having gotten the dictionary of dataframes known as element_dfs to hold the dataframes of each individual bridge element found in the data, I need to make the dataframes into a form that will allow for creation of data visualization.
#
#
# # Can a dictionary of dataframes have its keys changed by using another dictionary the keys of which match the original dataframe keys and join the keys in the original dataframe to the values in the second dictionary?
#
#
#
# # Recall that you want to make the values of the new_keys_dict come first in the join- with the original_dict keys following the underscore in the resulting original_dict
#
#
#
# # Place the value (description) from the el_names dictionary at the front of the existing element_dfs keys to make more acceptable variable names.  In other words the description e.g. topFlg_rc whose corresponding element number is 16 would take the form topFlg_rc_16 after this next function is used.
#
# # Generic dict variable name: new_dict_ind_bdg_elems (newly created dictionary of individual bridge elements) i.e. the dictionary of  dataframes with the specific bridge elements separated out of the larger merge that created df_data.

# # Generic dict variable name: exist_dict_mod_vals i.e. the existing dictionary,  values of which are to be modified- in this case adding a suffix.

# # Going to make a decision about how to proceed with this project: I am going to start analyzing the CS_2 data from the sets.  I expect it to have a more noticeable trend as time goes by and to be the most consequential of the data.  I do not expect the CS_1 data to have much in the way of a trend because it is the beginning state of all the different bridge elements.
# # The other decision I'm going to make at this time (08.23.24) is to only perform an analysis on the Reinforced Concrete Abutments of the bridges.  This element represents the largest set of elements in the State of California, much as it would in any dataset of highway bridges- all bridges need abutments, as these are the foundation of the bridge where it starts and ends- and in many civil and structural engineering tasks the foundation is always one of the most critical elements. And even if there are no interior supports for the span of a  bridge, the bridge will have abutments at each end of its span.

#
# # How and why would the TOTALQTY increase from one year to the next? Mainly by way of a planned increase in the capacity of the bridge meant to increase the width of a bridge (additional lanes of traffic being added) or because certain elements needed to be added to maintain the bridge at its daily traffic levels as would have been originally planned- i.e. adding an extra pile or column with regard to elements that are assessed using units of each, or perhaps lengthening the abutment of a bridge due to mistakes in the design or construction of a bridge.
#
# # It would be very noteworthy if a percentage of an element in one of the lower condition states such as CS_1, were to increase WITHOUT any increase in the overall TOTALQTY from one year to the next- as this would point to a repair or refurbishment of that element of that bridge.

From the distance between the coast and the coordinate, look for a trend in change of condition state based on distance from the coast.

I expect that this would stay relatively flat for the years observed and that for TOT_QTY and CS1 to be negatively correlated will take many more years of wear and tear on the bridges.
#
# # Additionally, I expect that the other condition states will be negatively correlated with TOT_QTY for the years observed here (2016 to 2023).

# # The condtion state of each element will depend on the TOT_QTY in the short term and time in the long term.

# # I'm not happy about this approach that I'm taking below- I just want to state that outright- There are probably features of the pd.date_range method that I am not aware of yet that may take the problem I am faced with (leap year basically causing the freq to leave the first several observations of year 2021 in 2020, i.e. the observations for the bridges with STRUCNUM = 000000000000008 or 000000000000019 for example which are the first 2 bridges observed each year because the bridges are in ascending numerical order- are corresponding to dates like 2020-12-30 00:00:00.0000 and 2020-12-31 00:00:00.0000) The use of the DateOffset or dt.is_leap_year to deal with this problem would be less work and more efficient but I'm trying to get this application up and working at this point now just shy of a year since my Career Lab!
